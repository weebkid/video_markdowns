# "Good Students"
## Intro

#### Things I'll do:

_Part 1_: What do high performance students ***do***?
* Go over a [study][study] explaining the habits of high-performing students
* Make a contrast to low performing students using personal findings and experience

_Part 2_: Who ***are*** high performance students
* The effort high-performance students put in
* Goals and motivation (of high-performance students)
---
### Low performing habits  
Note: For normal teens, highschool is relatively easy to pass. When someone is performing low, it's often due to bad habits. Some  people just aren't academically inclined. It's not a disability though. If you can't do well in school, find something you
 can perform well in.
 
* Skipping Class
* Not paying attention in class
* Idling
* Addictions (video games, TikTok, etc)
