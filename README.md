# "Good Students"
## Intro

#### Things I'll do:

_Part 1_: What do high performance students ***do***?
* Go over a [study][study] explaining the habits of high-performing students
* Make a contrast to low performing students using personal findings and experience

_Part 2_: Who ***are*** high performance students
* The effort high-performance students put in
* Goals and motivation (of high-performance students)

### Low performing habits  
Note: For normal teens, highschool is relatively easy to pass. When someone is performing low, it's often due to bad habits. Some  people just aren't academically inclined. It's not a disability though. If you can't do well in school, find something you
 can perform well in.
 
* Skipping Class
* Not paying attention in class
* Idling
* Addictions (video games, TikTok, etc)

### The Home and Habits
The home is very important in the development of habits. Most good (and bad) habits are formed at our homes. We learn courtesy at home, table manners, speech patterns, and many other habits that we often overlook at home.

In Jamaica, there's a common proverb:
> "Show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are."

This refers to the finding that people are a product of their environment. Your friends, family, and your physical environment as well. As students, we interact with our friends at school. At home however, we spend our time with family members and the common distrations of the home. 

These new stimuli make it different from school, where we have times when our sole attention is to be given to the teacher. At home, we have many choices of what to do, and making the choice to do school work often isn't prioritized. However, high-performance students have the habit of doing school work at home. Why is that?
